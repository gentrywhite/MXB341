*Solution*: 

The MLEs are $\hat{\theta}=\bar{y}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{y})^2$. Thus if $\sigma^2=a\theta^2$, then $\hat{a}=\hat{\sigma}^2/\hat{\theta}^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\bar{y})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}$.

The likelihood for the null hypothesis is $L_{0}$, which is found by writing the likelihood of the model with $a = 1$ and $\theta = \hat{\theta}.$:
$$
L_{0} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}(2\pi \hat{\theta}^2)^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{(y_{i}-\hat{\theta})^{2}}{2\hat{\theta}^2}\right\}
$$
$$
=(2\pi \bar{y}^2)^{-n/2}\exp\left\{-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{(y_{i}-\bar{y})^{2}}{2\bar{y}^{2}}\right\} $$

$$
=(2\pi \bar{y}^2)^{-n/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}} - n\right)\right\} 
$$

The likelihood for the alternative hypothesis is $L_{1}$:
$$
L_{1} = \prod_{i=1}^{n}(2\pi \hat{a}\hat{\theta}^{2})^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-\frac{(y_{i}-\hat{\theta})^{2}}{2\hat{a}\hat{\theta}}\right\}
$$
$$
=(2\pi\hat{a} \bar{y}^2)^{-n/2}\exp\left\{- \frac{n}{2}\right\}\\
$$

The GLRT can be simplified as
$$
\Lambda =\frac{L_0}{L_1} = \hat{a}^{n/2}\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}} \right).
$$
Note that 
$$
\hat{a} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \bar{y})^{2}}{n\bar{y}^{2}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{n\bar{y}^{2}} - 1
$$

To use the Wilk's theorem for the asymptotic test, we need 
$$
w = -2 \log(\Lambda) = n\log\hat{a} - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}} 
$$

and we would reject $H_{0}$ if $w > c$ where $c$ is chosen such that $P(X > c) = \alpha$ for an $\alpha$-level test and $X \sim \chi^{2}_{1}$.

For an exact (non-asymptotic) test, the critical region is
$$
\hat{a}^{n/2}\exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}} \right) < c_{1}$$
or equivalently
$$
n\log\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{n\bar{y}^{2}} - 1\right) - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}} < c_{2}
$$
Which we doesn't simplify any further.

We can use this exact test if the distribution of the LHS can be found... which is difficult. But is has been formulated in terms of a sufficient statistic^[Namely, $t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}}{\bar{y}^{2}}$] for which approximate methods could be used.
