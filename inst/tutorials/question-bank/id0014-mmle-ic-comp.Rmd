1. In this question we will compare how the AIC and BIC perform under simulated data. Assume the true data is generated from a Weibull distribution with $\lambda = 2$ and $\kappa = 1$. This can easily be simulated in `R`^[Use the code `rweibull(n = 20, shape = 1, scale = 2)` for a Weibull with scale $\lambda = 2$ and shape $\kappa=1$.]. Start by considering the case where $n=20$.

(a) Write two functions to find the MLEs of the inverse exponential and Weibull distribution^[The Weibull will require a numerical solver such as `optim()`.].
(b) Write functions to calculate the AIC and BIC for given parameter values of the inverse exponential and Weibull distributions.
(c) Using the code in the answer template, complete the function that performs one simulation of the information criteria decision we are trying to evaluate.
(d) Run the simulation under a variety of settings (e.g. small $n$ versus large $n$) and comment on how accurate the information criteria are under each of these scenarios.
