Let $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n$ be a random sample from a population described by the normal $N(\theta,a\theta^2)$ distribution, that is the variance of the distribution is $a\theta^2$ for $a > 0$. Determine the form of the generalised likelihood ratio test of $H_0:a=1$ against $H_1:a\ne 1$. Start by finding the MLEs of the distribution^[Hint: the maximum likelihood estimates from the normal distribution $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$ are $\hat{\mu} = \bar{y}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^{2} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \bar{y})^{2}$. The MLEs have an *invariance* property, so that the MLEs of $\theta$ and $a$ can be determined from those of $\theta$ and $a\theta$ by transformation.].
