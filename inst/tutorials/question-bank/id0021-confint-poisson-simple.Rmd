Let $y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_n$ be a random sample from a population described by the Poisson distribution with mean $\lambda$.

(a) Determine the likelihood of the data.

(b) What is the MLE for the model?

(c) What is the expected Fisher information for the model?

(d) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the MLE using the asymptotic normal approximation.
