A log-normal distribution has density function 
$$
f(x~\vert~\mu,\tau) = \frac{\tau^{1/2}}{x\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} \tau (\log x - \mu)^{2}  \right\}
$$
where $\mu$ and $\tau>0$ are parameters. 

(a) Show that this probability distribution belongs to the exponential family, when $\mu$ and $\tau$ are unknown parameters.

(b) Determine the form of the conjugate prior up to a constant of proportionality.

(c) Show that the conjugate prior for the log-normal distribution is a normal-gamma prior.
