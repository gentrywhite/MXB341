Let $y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}$ be a random sample of observations from a population described by the Uniform probability density function
$$
        p(y~\vert~\theta)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{\theta}, \qquad 0 \leq y \leq \theta\\
        0, \qquad \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}
$$
Two potential estimates of $\theta$ are 
$$
\hat{\theta}_{A}=\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n y_{i}
$$
$$
\hat{\theta}_{B} = \frac{n+1}{n}\max\{y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n}\}
$$

(a) Find the mean and variance of statistics $s_{1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} y_{i}$ and $s_{2} = \max(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n})$^[Hint: For the second statistic, determine the distribution of $s_{2}$, which is the $n$th order statistic $y_{(n)}$ where $y_{(1)} \leq y_{(2)}\leq \ldots \leq y_{(n)}$. Start by finding the CDF of the maximum.].
(b) Show that both these estimates are unbiased. 
(c) Which has the smaller sampling variance?
(d) Are either estimators consistent? Explain your answer.
(e) Is is possible to determine if either estimators are efficient? Explain your answer.
