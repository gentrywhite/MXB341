Implement a Gibbs sampler for the model in question 1 (theory) using `R`. 

(a) Write a one-dimensional MH sampler for the conditional distribution $(\tau~\vert~\mu,\alpha, \boldsymbol{y})$. Check that it works.
(b) Write a Gibbs sampler for $(\mu,\alpha~\vert~\tau, \boldsymbol{y})$. Check that it works as expected.
(c) Write a MH-within-Gibbs sampler for the full distribution using the solutions to (a) and (b). The Gibbs step for $\tau$ should simply use the MH step in (a).

Finally, comment on the performance of these algorithms
