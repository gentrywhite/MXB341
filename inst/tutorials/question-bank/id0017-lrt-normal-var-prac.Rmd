Suppose you observe the data, $\boldsymbol{y}$ given below, and you wish to perform the hypothesis test in Question 1 (theory) with 
$$
H_{0}: \sigma^{2} = 100$ \mbox{ versus } $H_{1}: \sigma^{2} = 20.
$$ 

a. Do you reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha = 0.05$? What is the $p$-value^[The $p$-value of a test is the probability of observing a test statistic equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. In this case, the critical region is in the left-tail ($\sigma^{2}_{0} < \sigma^{2}_{1}$), so the p-value is $P(T < t~\vert~H_{0} \text{ is true})$ where $t$ is the observed statistic.] of the test? 

b. Plot the distributions relating to the null and alternative hypothesis, along with where the observations occured. Discuss how this graph relates to the hypothesis test. 

The data are: $\mathbf{y}=(9.91, 4.37, -1.06, 7.63, 0.78, 2.73, -1.29, 2.78, -4.98, 2.45)$
